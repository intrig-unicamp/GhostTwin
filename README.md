# GhostTwin: Towards real-time Network Digital Twins (NTDs)


## Overview
GhostTwin is a lightweight and easy-to-deploy framework for creating and operating high-fidelity Network Digital Twins (NDTs). It emulates the behavior and configuration of programmable physical networks using a SmartNIC-based hardware emulator. GhostTwin is the first open-source proof-of-concept for NDT deployment, enabling realistic and scalable testing by incorporating physical effects such as packet loss and residual bandwidth.

## Components
- Tofino fine-grained monitoring
- GhostTwin agent, orchestrating model updates and information collection.
- Network emulation through SmartNet
